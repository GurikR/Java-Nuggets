## Binary to Integer

int x = 0b1100110
System.out.println(x);   #where 110 is binary part prepended with 0b, 0b110 is binary literal form

**output**: 6

Another way to convert binary to decimal is to use

**Integer.parseInt("110", 2);**

## Usage of underscores in numbers

long anotherLong = 2_147_483_648L;  L should be used instead of lowercase l to distinguish from one (1).
int bitPattern = 0b0001_1100__0011_0111__0010_1011__1010_0011

both are valid syntax in runtime underscore(_) will be removed.

## Try with resources code block

try(OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);
 InputStream is = url.openStream()){

} catch(){

}

[OutputStream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html) implements [AutoCloseable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html)
which under the hood closes the the outputstream of execution of try block
